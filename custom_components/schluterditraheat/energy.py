"""Long-term energy statistics for Schluter DITRA-HEAT.

Imports the cloud's hourly consumption history into Home Assistant's long-term
statistics so each thermostat's energy usage appears in the Energy dashboard.
One external statistic is maintained per device, sourced from this integration's
domain.

The cloud only serves a rolling window of roughly the last 24 hours of hourly
buckets, so an import can only ever recover that much history: hours missed
while Home Assistant was down for longer than the window are gone for good and
are simply absent from the cumulative sum.
